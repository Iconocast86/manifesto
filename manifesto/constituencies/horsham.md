## Council Transparency

We are dedicated to complete transparency at all levels of government, including 
local councils.

Horsham district council should end its current cabinet system, which allows important
decisions to be taken in private by a dominant party, and change back to a system where 
all councillors can be involved in decision-making.

## Gatwick Expansion

We are [opposed to expansion of all air travel](/manifesto/transport.html#end-uk-airport-expansion)
until it can become carbon neutral. This naturally means we are opposed to the 
expansion of Gatwick airport in particular.

## Fracking

Our national manifesto [bans new fossil fuel extraction](/manifesto/energy.html#fossil-fuel-industry)
in the UK, as the only way to sufficiently reduce emissions from fossil fuels is
to leave them in the ground. This means we are opposed to fracking for oil or natural gas, both in the Weald and all across the UK.
